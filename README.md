# DQN implementation for Atari games with Noisy Networks

This notebook is adapted from the [Pytorch tutorial about DQN](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html). It notably uses CNN and Noisy networks instead of the Fully Connected architecture to handle the games.
